The General Secretary of the Evangelical Church Winning All (ECWA), Rev. Yunusa Nmadu Jnr has alleged that the Muslim-Muslim ticket fielded by the All Progressives Congress, APC, is a plot for its candidate, Bola Tinubu, to fail the 2023 presidential election.

#### Nmadu insisted that those who advised Tinubu to nominate the former Borno state governor, Kashim Shettima as his running mate do not mean well for him and they have simply laid a trap for him to fail.  
The ECWA scribe said this while speaking to journalists in Kaduna on Tuesday.

He added that the same faith ticket was also an insult to other faith in the land.

He said,

“Those who are the flying the Muslim-Muslim ticket either in Kaduna State or at the Federal level, to be categorical, have failed the examination already.  
  
“This is not in the interest of the Muslims neither is it in the interest of the Christians. I will never support the same faith ticket even if it is Christian-Christian ticket where both faiths are almost equal.  
“Of course, there are states where there is nothing you can do about it, especially in a predominantly Muslim state, you can’t go there and ask for a Muslim-Christian ticket. It’s understandable. And there are states that are predominantly Christians that you can’t go and ask for Christian-Muslim ticket.

But I don’t know how anybody in their political calculation will ever think they will win an election in Nigeria without the Christians or win an election in Nigeria without the Muslims or win an election without people of no faith.

“This is our country. We are so divided that in the last seven years, the gap has increased so wide and it is expected that any government that is coming in now, should emphasise more on unity and how to bring the people together.”

## He maintained that the Muslim-Muslim ticket was dead on arrival and it was not in the best interest of the country.

“I believe again that this is my personal opinion, that because they want him to fail the election, they are asking him to do it so that he can fail and fail very well  
“Muslim-Muslim ticket is divisive; it does not encourage cohesion; it does not bring the country together and what we need now more than ever before is national unity and we need whoever that will bring us together, respecting everyone.

“Again, some of the reasons they gave for the same faith ticket is so mundane and so unintellectual. For instance, they said that we should be concerned about those who are coming to fix the country and not concern about religion.

“Are we saying those to fix the country are only found in one faith? They are also saying that its about competence. For me, I find that very insulting.



“What they are saying is that ‘we search as it is traditional from other faith and we could not find anybody that is competent’. That argument hold doesn’t hold water,” he added.
