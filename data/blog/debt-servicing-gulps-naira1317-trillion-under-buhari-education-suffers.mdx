> While commenting on the development, the ASUU Chairman at the Federal University of Technology, Minna, Dr Gbolahan Bolarin, said the government did not care about education.

But a foremost economist, Bismarck Rewane, stated, “The debt service is necessary to finance the expenditure that was incurred. There is a crisis in the education sector, no question about it and the strike is only a symptom of the fundamental defect in the education system. I’m saying that the amount spent on education should be increased but because the revenues are down, we can only increase it by borrowing more so we cannot, on the one hand, criticise the government for borrowing more and at the same time criticise the government for spending less.”

### On his part, the Director.

Research and Strategist, Chapel Hill Denham, Tajudeen Ibrahim, stated that the future of education funding in Nigeria was bleak. He stated, “I think the future of education funding in Nigeria is weak because it doesn’t seem like the government has a concrete plan for the education sector. In as much as that sector is not seeing inflows from investments, what would happen is either the government borrows to finance that sector or they neglect that sector, just like they are currently doing. Education doesn’t bring much income as a sector, it is a sector that the government has to invest in for long-term benefits.”_An economic expert and seasoned academic at Pan Atlantic University, Dr Olusegun Vincent, explained that the moment there was a debt obligation, it becomes a first line charge in revenue, irrespective of other priorities whether education, agriculture, or defence.Varsity lecturers, others.The spending on debt servicing and the education sector came to the fore on Thursday as findings by our correspondents showed that lecturers in universities, polytechnics and colleges of education had embarked on no fewer than 837 days of strike since the inception of the regime of the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari in May 2015._ASUU is currently on strike in protest against members’ poor welfare and lack of adequate funds for universities among others.
